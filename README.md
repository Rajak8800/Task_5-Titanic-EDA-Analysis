# Task_5-Titanic-EDA-Analysis
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using statistical summaries and graphical visualizations.

ðŸ›  Tools Used
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“š Steps Performed
Loaded the Titanic dataset.

Checked basic information and dataset structure using .info(), .describe().

Identified missing values and distributions.

Visualized the dataset using histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, heatmaps, and pairplots.

Analyzed feature relationships with survival rates.

Summarized key findings and observations.

ðŸ“Š Key Findings
Gender: Females had a much higher survival rate than males.

Passenger Class: 1st class passengers had better survival chances compared to 2nd and 3rd class.

Age: Children and younger passengers had better survival probabilities.

Fare: Higher fare-paying passengers tended to survive more.

Missing Values: Age and Cabin columns have notable missing data; Cabin has the highest.

ðŸ“‚ Files Included
Titanic_Dataset_EDA.ipynb - Complete EDA code notebook.

Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf - Written report summarizing findings and insights.

ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone this repository.

Open the Jupyter Notebook.

Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.

Review the final PDF report for summarized observations.

âœ… Conclusion
EDA provided essential insights into the Titanic dataset which can help in building predictive models. Gender, passenger class, and age are key factors influencing survival
